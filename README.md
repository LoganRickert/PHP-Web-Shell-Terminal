This script is for educational purposes only. NEVER upload this script to a server that you do not explicity own. YOU are responsible for anything you do with this script.

## Usage

Just type the terminal command you wish to run on the server into the prompt.

The following are custom commands:
- history - Displays commands executed.
- clear - Clears the console.
- help - Displays this message.
- open &lt;file&gt; - Opens file in new window. Displayed as plain text.
- open /phpinfo - Displays phpinfo() instead of file in new window.
- upload &lt;dir&gt; - Uploads attached file to directory. Ex: upload /tmp/
- less &lt;command&gt; - q to quit, space to page down. Ex: less cat index.php
- lessl &lt;command&gt; - less with line numbers. Ex: lessl cat index.php

The second file, hsXZgT9wXtLpnMqP.php, is the same file as terminal.php and will work exactly the same, but it has been obfuscate using http://www.pipsomania.com/best_php_obfuscator.do

Please use the second script when you want to actually use the script.
